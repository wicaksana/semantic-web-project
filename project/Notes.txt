What to do:
1. get the movie dataset, and convert it to RDF dataset
2. enrich the RDF dataset with self-developed ontology
2. link the dataset to DBPedia
3. enrich the data with established ontologies
4. run some SPARQL queries finding in data 
5. show some reasonings


Minimum things to do:
- self-developed ontology (at least 5 classes)
- enrich the original data with some semantic web facility
- demonstrate some non-trivial reasonings


This project generally does what the linked open data field intended to do.
